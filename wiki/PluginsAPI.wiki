= Introduction =

This document talk about the plugin system of VLCShares. This infos are aimed for developer.

= System Architecture =

VLCShares is built upon [http://framework.zend.com/ ZendFramework]. Understanding of the functioning of the framework is a recommended prerequisite to better understand how VLCShares works.

VLCShares follows the MVC Pattern and integrates an independent Plugins System. Main controllers follow the baselines of ZendFramework (so, they are placed inside _application/controllers/_ folder) and follow ZendFramework name rules.

Standard main controllers are:
  * *IndexController*: index controller. Redirect the application flow to Management interface or Browse interface and provides collections index page.
  * *ManageController*: management page controller. Dashboard and configs panels are provided by this controller. 
  * *BrowseController*: manage the browse/stream functionality. The main work of this plugin is to reassemble resource returned by plugins.
  * *ControlsController*: provides functionality for controls vlc's streams.
  * *TestController*: execute system test and provides results.
  * *ErrorController*: display error information
  * *ConfigController*: provide a way to manage lazy plugins configurations without the need of create a plugin management interface for each plugin.
  * *InstallerController*: execute initial configuration of VLCShares

The following scheme reproduce the transactions between controlles and pages while in browse and reproduction mode
