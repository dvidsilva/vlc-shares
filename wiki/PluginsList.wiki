=Plugin Installer=

The PluginInstaller is a special plugin that allows the installation of external plugins inside VLCShares

It's installed by default from vlc-shares 0.5.1beta1 (but for some bugs, plugin eggs for version 0.5.1beta1 aren't compatible with PluginInstaller version that comes with vlc-shares 0.5.1beta2 or later.

The PluginInstaller interface is available clicking on the icon in the vlc-shares's dashboard:
