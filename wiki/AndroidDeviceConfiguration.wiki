    # If the plugin isn't enabled click on *VLCShares - configure*
    # Search in the right column the plugin _WiimcPlxRenderer_ and enabled it
  # Click on *WiiMC support*
  # Set:

  # Open the Android Phone's browser to http:://IP_ADDRESS/vlc-shares/public

= Known issues =

  * Some apps in Android Market allow to switch the Android Phone's browser user agent to something different from a default Android OS signature. VLCShares routine for Android OS recognition check for default signature, so if you change your user-agent VLC could identify your device wrongly.
  * Some HTC Desire 2.2 expose by default a wrong browser signature. Please, be sure to change it back to Android Platform default.
